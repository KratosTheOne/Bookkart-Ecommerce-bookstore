These limits cannot be changed.</p>\n *          <p>You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using <a>PutRecord</a>. The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000\n *          KB in size, and any kind of data.

To\n *          disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in\n *          the data, such as a newline (<code>\\n</code>) or some other character unique within the\n *          data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the\n *          data from the destination.</p>\n *          <p>The <a>PutRecordBatch</a> response includes a count of failed records,\n *             <code>FailedPutCount</code>, and an array of responses, <code>RequestResponses</code>.\n *          Even if the <a>PutRecordBatch</a> call succeeds, the value of\n *             <code>FailedPutCount</code> may be greater than 0, indicating that there are records for\n *          which the operation didn't succeed. Each entry in the <code>RequestResponses</code> array\n *          provides additional information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a\n *          record in the request array using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The\n *          response array always includes the same number of records as the request array.\n *             <code>RequestResponses</code> includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed\n *          records.

If <code>FailedPutCount</code> is greater than 0, retry the request,\n *          resending only those records that might have failed processing.
